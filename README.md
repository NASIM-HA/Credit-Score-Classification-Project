# Credit Assessment Through Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository houses a research project aimed at advancing credit assessment methodologies through the application of machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to develop an intelligent system capable of accurately predicting credit scores and categorizing individuals into appropriate credit score brackets. The project emphasizes precision, efficiency, objectivity, and transparency in credit assessment processes, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional methodologies and machine learning-driven solutions.

## Research Question

The fundamental research question guiding this project is: How can machine learning models effectively predict credit scores and classify individuals into suitable credit score brackets using financial and personal information datasets? This question sets the trajectory for innovative solutions poised to revolutionize credit assessment practices.

## Approach

The project primarily adopts regression methods for analysis due to their adaptability and effectiveness in handling complex datasets. By leveraging regression techniques, the aim is to enhance the efficacy and consistency of credit score assessment while minimizing manual intervention and scoring disparities. Python serves as the primary programming language, offering robust libraries and an intuitive syntax for model development, implementation, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 50,000 entries spanning 27 attributes derived from various financial and personal details. This substantial volume of data provides a comprehensive basis for analysis and model development.
